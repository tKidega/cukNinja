  <h5 class='main4Title'>This is the system's default bulletin board -
    Message postings are separated from each other by use of a hyphen -
    <strong><i>This is posting one</i>. (Date, Aurthor)</strong> -
    <strong><i>This is posting two</i>. (Date, Aurthor)</strong> -
    The system is still under construction therefore some functionality
    may be limited or non existent.
